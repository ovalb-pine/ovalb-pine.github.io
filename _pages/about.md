I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My research interests include deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in developing efficient and interpretable machine learning models.

I am currently working on several exciting projects involving neural network optimization and applications of AI in real-world problems. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical applications.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and have worked on various research projects in collaboration with industry partners and academic institutions.

Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and blog posts to learn more about my work. I'm always open to collaborations and discussions about research opportunities.
